# Chore Door
Simple online game created with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML

# Introduction
This project was created as part of the Codeacademy project aimed at enhancing skills in Javascript. The official Codeademy version can be found [at this link](https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/projects/chore-door/chore-door-final/index.html){:target="_blank"}.

This version of Chore Door was created independently of Codecademy's instructions to improve independent learning and creative problem-solving.

Several changes were made from the Codecademy version:
  * I adjusted the CSS to include more height and margin in the header, expand the width of the main text, and add more height to the main button to better vertically center the text.
  * I removed the HTML tables and used divs and flexbox to better format the content.
  * In Javascript, I saw that the different door combinations were hard-coded into a switch statement, and I was hoping to have live, active logic to make the code more dynamic. I accomplished this using if/else statements and reduced the overall lines of code nearly by half.
